### 2. Factors influencing listing duration

Key variables affecting how long a property stays on the market:

| Factor | Observation |
|--------|-------------|
| Total area | Smaller apartments sell faster, especially in Leningrad Region. |
| Price per square meter | Lower-priced apartments sell faster in Saint Petersburg. |
| Floor location | Apartments on extreme floors (first and top) tend to stay longer on the market. |
| Number of rooms | Studios and 1-bedroom apartments have the shortest exposure. |

**Regional differences:**

- **Leningrad Region:** Speed of sale strongly depends on apartment size; smaller units sell faster. Price per m² is lower. Last-floor apartments take longer to sell.  
- **Saint Petersburg:** Price per m² and total area are the main drivers. Last-floor apartments take longer to sell as well. Market volume is ~4 times higher, and price per m² is ~40% higher than in Leningrad Region.
